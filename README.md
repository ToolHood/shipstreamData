## Extension Features Explained

### 1. **Copy Data Functionality**:
   - This feature uses the extension to extract the relevant user data from Zendesk or other supported platforms. It captures details such as name, address, and ticket ID using regular expressions to match specific patterns in the page content.
   
### 2. **Paste Data Functionality**:
   - The extension detects if you're on the Caseking platform and automatically populates the form fields based on the previously copied data.
   - The system automatically maps the copied data to form fields such as `order-shipping_address_firstname`, `order-shipping_address_lastname`, `order-shipping_address_street0`, `order-shipping_address_city`, `order-shipping_address_postcode`, `order-shipping_address_email`, and `order-shipping_address_telephone`.

### 3. **Telephone Disguise**:
   - This toggle feature allows you to hide the customer's real phone number by replacing it with a default number (`0123456789`), which is useful in cases where phone privacy is required.
   - By default, the phone number will be copied and pasted, but this can be switched with a simple toggle button to disguise it.

## Customization

The extension can be customized to fit your needs by modifying the following:

1. **Data Extraction Patterns**:
   - If you need to extract different or additional fields, you can modify the regular expressions in the `popup.js` file.
   
2. **Phone Number Disguise**:
   - The default number for phone number disguise (`0123456789`) can be changed in the `popup.js` file if needed.

3. **Styling**:
   - The look and feel of the popup can be adjusted by modifying the CSS in the `popup.html` file. The current design is inspired by **Caseking's** branding, but you can customize it further.

## Known Issues

1. **Compatibility**:
   - The extension is designed for use with the Chrome browser and may not work with other browsers.
   
2. **Form Field Detection**:
   - The extension assumes specific form field IDs on the Zendesk and Shipstream platform. If these IDs change, the extension may need to be updated.

3. **Platform Compatibility**:
   - The extension is designed to extract data from platforms like Zendesk. If you need it to work with other platforms, adjustments will be needed to the extraction logic.
